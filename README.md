## üß† How It Works

### RAG Implementation

The AI Resume Analyzer uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the Deep Seek model's capabilities:

1. **Document Processing**: Resumes are parsed and converted into embeddings
2. **Knowledge Base**: Industry-specific requirements and best practices are stored in a vector database
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant information is retrieved based on the resume content or job description
4. **Generation**: The Deep Seek model generates insights by combining retrieved information with its trained knowledge

### Resume Analysis Flow

1. Document parsing and text extraction
2. Section identification and classification
3. Skills and experience extraction
4. Comparison against industry standards
5. Generation of improvement suggestions

### HR Matching Flow

1. Job description parsing and requirement extraction
2. Resume batch processing
3. Semantic matching between requirements and qualifications
4. Candidate ranking and summary generation
